If you would rather watch a video I found online that goes through how to download it  then be my guest but it leaves out the lemon loader/melon loader part. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko8h58Tlbj8

1.How ever you installed your apk for gorilla tag horror do the same for the melon/lemmon loader apk file I listed above.
(if you need help with this step look up how to install apks on quest standalone) (If the method you are using requires mobile vr station and you dont see the app permisions or it isnt working   reinstall mobile vr station and it hopefully should be resolved)

 2.Find gorilla tag horror in lemon loader then patch Gorilla tag horror after accpeting all of the  app permissions for lemon loader/ melon loader.
(If you see files make sure to press use this folder on the bottom of lemmon loader) (If you see a button that says setup make sure you click setup as this I believe loads into the file screen I was talking about a few seconds ago.) (ALSO if it says something like Patching failed your version is out of date  make sure to download the updated version above.)


WARNING: when patching if you are in gorilla tag horror when it asks you to reinstall the game it will kick you and you have to reinstall the game again directly from  https://lemmondev.itch.io/gorilla-tag-horror so make sure to exit gorilla tag horror before patching. 

WARNING: when patching if you exit lemon loader  without seeing the prompt patch successfull  somewhere on the patching screen  you will also have to directly reinstall the game from https://lemmondev.itch.io/gorilla-tag-horror because the patching is incomplete.

WARNING: if you happen to reinstall the game because something went wrong with patching and it didnt reinstall the game back to your unknown sources tab on your  headset you will have to repatch as your new gorilla tag horror apk is not patched. Make sure you delete the old gorilla tag horror apk if you are going to install a new one.

3. If you followed the steps thorougly and lemon loader actually worked then you need to install an apk onto your headset called "amaze file manager"  This is what you will need to create  a mods folder if you dont already have one and import the mod menu to. I am not going to go into where you can find the  apk as I dont want to give you a bad download link  that is  is out of date You could find a turtorial online that has an up to date download link and a step to step turtorial on how to download it.

4. After you download amaze to your headset go to the back arrow on the top left hand corner of amaze then go to the top button I believe it is called DCIM or something simalar open that go to andriod then data scroll up or down until you see .com lemmon gorilla tag open it then open "files" then this is where you will make a folde titled, "mods" if you dont already see one.

5.  Download the dll file I posted in the code section of the github page to your headset go back to the  downloads section  on amaze find the dll file you just downloaded  click the three dots by the dll file then copy go all the way back to .com lemmon gorilla tag and open the folder you previously titled "mods" and paste the dll file into the "mods" folder.

6.  after all of that you finally know how to mod gorilla tag horror if you dont see a mod menu in the corner of your screen when you click both of your joysticks together at once  you did something wrong. you can go back and redo the previous steps If you dont see a mod menu in the corner of your screen.

7. If you do see a mod menu then congrats you did it correctly! Now if you want to control the menu just hold down the left joystick press the right trigger to move down the menu and press the grip button to select.
